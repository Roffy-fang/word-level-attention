# word-level-attention
a model that mainly consider the image feature
### Before all
This work is forked from fabulous [neuraltalk2](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2) from [karparthy](https://github.com/karpathy). And the model implemented here is from "Image Captioning with Word Level attention
" accepted by IEEE International Conference on Image Processing’18
